MuBdI Platform-Artificial Life System Build For Blockchain
=====================================
Testing : ![CI](https://github.com/Nur1Labs/AriA/workflows/CI/badge.svg?branch=master)
ArIa Master : ![ArIa](https://github.com/Nur1Labs/AriA/workflows/ArIa/badge.svg)

MuBdI is Platform Blockchain for QaWiYyu.Desclaimer note. After Consensus we herby make split aria-tokenizer and aria self. Cause distribute scammer. Auditing stop
make tokenizer aria is stop listing project on 20th January, 2019. And total stop services and do swap to AriA[Public] or Imanity[Private] And MuBdI as official new platform at 25th January, 2019

MuBdI signed on new Fork(commited 07466c3) as Dirham/Dinar trace make USD is more bad way system since general viruses comes Covid-19. And make gold, Dirham and Dinar as alternative. 
while AriA care for this time to put cold storage wallet. And as used based continental from dubai community agreement number 15(committed 81e71b3).
It's called "from ummah to ummah". or people to people. Make MuBdI signal for whole fiat enemy and e-wallet based bank resides.

there is directory tree below : 

1. archived : place updates Core MuBdI Engine[all stuff there like key, hash and consensus].
3. base : code base for MuBdI like devices core to wallet[no need soon as we have many repos]. here HardFork settings too.
5. .circleci : this for expert of the core developer only.

listed nodes developement tags(nametag_install.sh).

1. cn = core nodes. for main cores system install.
2. wn = mainly for wallet nodes.
3. mn = masternodes only.
4. en = for exchanger nodes.
5. tn = testing nodes. for test nodes only.
6. rn = rebuild nodes. easily upgraded nodes.

New Tags Roles :

[DevTag][Target]

Notes :

DevTag : up there

Target : system/subsystem. System for main aria. AriA not have masternodes. Subsystem is child aria. Has masternodes. so update/upgrades same.

Nodes :

CN = Central Nodes. Used as Main Central Nodes running. Producing Blockchain.

MN = Masternodes. Used as Masternodes.

TN = Token Nodes. Used for token only.

BN = Broadcast Nodes. Used For Websites.

RN = Radio Nodes. Used for Ledger and Android system.
